FolderMate is an application that allows users to find, filter and organise files within multiple folders.

# EN
This application is a simple file search application with an interface designed using the PyQt5 library. The user can start the search process by specifying the path to the folder he/she wants to search and entering the file extension he/she wants to search.

The search results are listed in the interface with the file name and full path, and users can open the file by clicking on any result. If the file to be opened is an image, the application can display this image. 

Furthermore, various features of the application such as background colour, button colours and textbox colours can be customised to make the design look more modern.
